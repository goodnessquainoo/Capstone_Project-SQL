Famous Ghanaian Entertainers Database
This project is a structured SQL-based database designed to model and analyze detailed information about prominent Ghanaian celebrities. It showcases how real-life data—such as movies, music, awards, possessions, and industry contributions—can be transformed into relational tables to support meaningful insights and decision-making through SQL queries.

Overview
The core of the project centers around designing a normalized relational database schema that captures multiple aspects of each celebrity’s public and financial life. The schema includes the following:

People Table: Contains personal information such as celebrity name, date of birth, nationality, region, and occupation.

Movies Table: Records the movies acted in by celebrities, including genre and box office revenue.

Music Table: Stores musical information such as album names, release years, genres, and streaming numbers.

Awards Table: Tracks awards received by celebrities, including category and year won.

Possessions Table: Represents valuable assets owned by celebrities, including the type (e.g., car, island), purchase year, and estimated net worth.

Contributions Table: Captures contributions celebrities have made to the movie or music industries (e.g., as a producer, director, or featured artist).

What Was Done
Database Design: Tables were created with appropriate primary and foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity and ensure scalability. All tables were normalized to minimize redundancy.

Data Insertion: Sample data was inserted into each table to simulate real-world records of well-known Ghanaian entertainers.

Querying for Insights: A series of targeted SQL queries were written to analyze and extract insights from the data. These included:

Identifying celebrities who meet both artistic and commercial success metrics.

Filtering entertainers based on genre preferences and financial thresholds.

Comparing average net worth across different entertainment genres.

Analyzing the overlap between award recognition and asset accumulation.

Finding multi-talented individuals who excel in both music and film.

Investigating trends over time, such as recent purchases or album releases.

Industry Comparison: The project ends with a comparison of net worth between celebrities in the music industry versus those in the film industry, segmented by genre.

Purpose
The project demonstrates how SQL can be used not just for simple data storage or retrieval, but also for answering complex analytical questions. It blends data modeling, querying, and critical thinking—providing a strong foundation for real-world applications such as business intelligence, entertainment analytics, and financial forecasting.
